# Guidr Marketing Page

> Guidr helps backcountry guides record and share their excursions.

Backcountry guides can explore new routes and find clients. Outfitters and potential clients can view a guide’s Outdoor Resume to help make decisions about their future excursions. With Guidr, Guides of all types log their private/professional trips to build their Outdoor Resume, which can be shared with potential clients and outfitters.

This is the marketing page for the app designed during a Lambda School build week.
